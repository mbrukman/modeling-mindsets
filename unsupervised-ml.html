<!-- a joke -->
<p>A group of supervised learners and one unsupervised learner decide to climb a mountain.
The trip quickly turns into a race: Who will be the first to reach the top of the mountain, and who will be the first back to the hut?
The supervised learners try to outrun each other, one faster than the other.
The unsupervised learner quickly falls behind.
After an exhausting day, one by one, they return to their hut.
To their surprise, the unsupervised learner is already joyfully waiting for them in the hut.
Everyone was eager to know how the unsupervised learner managed to climb faster than them.
“When you all sprinted off, I took a detour,” the unsupervised learner reported,“You won’t believe this, but I found a rare mushroom that is not supposed to grow in this area. I have also divided the area around the hut according to the vegetation you find there. But the best part is that …”
“Wait!” interrupts one of the supervised learners, “You were not only the first one back, but you also did all these other things?”
“I guess so”, the unsupervised learner admits, a little puzzled.
“How long did it take you to climb the mountain? Did you find a shortcut? We haven’t seen you all day.”, asks another supervised learner.
“Mountain? I didn’t see any mountains.”</p>
<!-- unsupervised term associations "Unsupervised" sounds like a step away from chaos and anarchy.
Unsupervised sounds like letting kids play alone, only to discover new "artwork" on the walls later.
Unsupervised sounds like forgetting the pizza in the oven and being startled by the smoke detector.
Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, sounds very promising.
It sounds like the model is figuring things out on its own.
The truth is that unsupervised learning is just another form of machine learning.
Unsupervised learning is without a ground truth like supervised learning requires.
It's also without a reward function as reinforcement learning is built upon.
The mindset is one or two steps closer to anarchy than the other machine learning mindsets, but it's far from chaos.
In fact, it's a very useful mindset for finding patterns in the data.

<!-- example customer segmentation -->
<p>Tip Top Travel, a travel agency I just made up, offers a wide range of trips, from all-inclusive holidays in Spain to hiking trips in Norway and weekend city trips to Paris.
They have a huge database on the booking history of their customers:
The date of the trip, the destination, group size, cost of the trip, and so on.
And yet, they know surprisingly little about the general patterns in their data:
Are there certain prototypes of customers?
Do customers who book trips to Norway, for example, also book trips to Sweden?
Our imaginary travel company’s big data is a dream for unsupervised learners.
They might start with a cluster analysis to get an overview Tip Top Travel’s different customer types.
A cluster is a group of customers with similar travel patterns.
<!-- some clustering details using k-means -->
Similar means that the customers in a cluster are “close” in terms of their feature values, such as booking frequency, travel locations, and average cost of the trip.
If Tom books 4 trips per year, he is more similar to Tina, who books 5 trips per year than Philipp, who books 1 per year.
It gets more tricky because the measure of distance between travelers has to combine features that were measured at very different scales, such as amount of money, geographical location, counts, and so on.
But I’ll rant about that problem later.
With such a distance measure, there are many clustering algorithms to choose from that can detect clusters.
For example, the k-means algorithm.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:clustering1"></span>
<img src="figures/clustering1-1.png" alt="Three clusters for two features (x-axis and y-axis) based on k-means clustering." width="\textwidth" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 11.1: Three clusters for two features (x-axis and y-axis) based on k-means clustering.
</p>
</div>
<!-- how k-means works -->
<p>The k-means algorithm divides our customers into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> clusters.
The number of clusters <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> must be chosen by the modeler.
The algorithm start with random cluster centers.
These cluster centers are iteratively optimized so that all customers in the same cluster are close to each other.
Each customer is assigned to the cluster with the closest center.
The objective of the k-means algorithm is to find cluster centers that minimize the distances between centers and assigned data points, averaged over all customers.</p>
<!-- clustering done -->
<p>Great! We have clusters.
Now what?
We wanted to know what kind of customers Tip Top Travel has.
To do this, we can interpret the cluster centers as prototypes of customers.
One cluster could be “families looking for relaxation”.
The cluster center is a customer that books about twice a year for 1.9 adults and 2.1 children.
The most common destination is all-inclusive hotels with pool and beach access, where parents can drop off their kids for an all-day entertainment program and then the adults can have their first beer at the pool bar 11 AM.
Cluster numero dos is “luxury explorer”.
Customers in this cluster book an average of 0.7 trips per year for 1.7 adults, with varying destinations in nature with some adventure aspect: hiking, canoeing and camping.
Depending on the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> chosen by the modelers, there might be more clusters, and they might not always map to some easily interpretable group of travelers.
The more interpretable the clusters are, the more the marketing department will love the results.
Cluster analysis can provide data-driven insights about customers and offers a narrative angle on which to build marketing campaigns.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> The Unsupervised Learning Mindset<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#the-unsupervised-learning-mindset" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<!-- A mindset of excitement -->
<p>Unsupervised learning is like a journey of discovery.
A dataset suddenly becomes a treasure chest potentially filled with valuable insights.
The supervised learner can only watch from the sidelines: sipping an energy drink, preparing for the next race; the only excitement is what the stopwatch will show this time.</p>
<!-- what is unsupervised learning? -->
<p>Unsupervised learning is a machine learning mindset: task-driven, computer-oriented, and externally motivated.
Task-driven: We use unsupervised learning to solve specific tasks, such as clustering, anomaly detection, or finding a better representation of the data.
Computer-oriented: Like supervised learning, its unsupervised counterpart is motivated by the premise of having a computer, rather than by the premise of a theory where it’s simply convenient to have a computer.
Unsupervised learning is externally motivated: While measuring performance is more difficult than in other machine learning mindsets, successfully completing the task is more important than following a particular “recipe” (such as using probability theory).</p>
<!-- uniting traits of unsupervised -->
<p>Unsupervised learning is a less coherent mindset than supervised learning with its very rigorous evaluation and Zen-like mindset of optimization.
Unsupervised learning is about discovering patterns in the data, which sounds a bit fuzzy.
Fortunately, we can use the language of probability theory to make it more understandable.
Unsupervised learning is about finding a more compact representation of the joint distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span> or revealing some aspects of <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span>.
Unsupervised learning includes a broad range of tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clustering finds modes of the distribution.</li>
<li>Anomaly detection finds extreme data points.</li>
<li>Association rule learning finds modes in binary feature distributions.</li>
<li>Dimensionality reduction finds lower-dimensional descriptions of the data.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<!-- why not full distribution? -->
<p>Why do we need unsupervised learning anyway?
Can’t we just hire a statistician to estimate <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span> and derive all these interesting aspects from that estimate?
Well, estimating the joint distribution is extremely difficult with high-dimensional data.
The difficulties in estimating <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span> become difficult even with more than a handful of features when the distribution is complex, let alone image or text data.</p>
<!-- supervised versus unsupervised -->
<p>We can also express supervised learning as learning a distribution.
But it’s “only” the conditional distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(Y|X)\)</span>, which is much easier to learn than the full joint distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span>.
Supervised learning is about selecting one feature and making it “special”, which we also express by giving it a different letter (<span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>).
In unsupervised learning, on the other hand, all features are treated the same.
Of course, each algorithm can give different weights to the features depending on the task.</p>
<!-- absence of Y -->
<p>The lack of a target <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> to predict also means we have no ground truth to compare our results to.
It’s more like, “Here are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> data points, please find something interesting.”
Then you say “Here’s something interesting: I found these 10 clusters.”
But you’ll never get any feedback on whether these were the “right” clusters.
There is no one to pat you on the back and say “You did a great job.”
Your strength as an unsupervised learner must come from within!
That’s why unsupervised learning is sometimes called learning without a teacher:
There is not teacher to correct the model.
This is also why we can clearly distinguish supervised learning as its own mindset and why it’s not just a special case of unsupervised learning.</p>
<!-- An Open  Mindset -->
<p>To be more cheerful about unsupervised learning:
It’s, in many ways, an open mindset.
Unsupervised learning means being open to surprises and discovering hidden patterns.
The word “pattern” hides a potpourri of meanings: clusters, outliers, feature representations, association rules, …
The mindset is also open in the sense that the range of methods is huge, even for a machine learning mindset.
For clustering alone, there are so many different approaches.
If I had to pick one modeling mindset that is the most inclusive, I would choose unsupervised learning (in terms of methods, not necessarily people).
Next to this hippie community, supervised learners look like dull optimizers who sit in their offices with fine suits trying to increase sales for the second quarter.</p>
<!-- still optimization -->
<p>Full disclosure: unsupervised learning also involves optimization.
But there is much more freedom in the optimization objective because there is no ground truth.
The same is true for performance metrics and benchmarks:
It’s part of the mindset to evaluate models, but there’s a lot of ambiguity about how to evaluate unsupervised solutions.
For example, in cluster analysis, we could measure cluster purity, the silhouette score, various indexes, look at elbow plots, and so on.
One can also create a long list of metrics for supervised learning, but at least they agree on when they become zero (or reach their minimum):
When the target is accurately predicted.
A luxury that doesn’t exist in unsupervised learning.</p>

<div id="many-tasks" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="11.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Many Tasks<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#many-tasks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>To get a better understanding of unsupervised learning, let’s take a look at some of the tasks that are typical of the mindset.</p>
<div id="clustering-and-outlier-detection" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="11.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.1</span> Clustering and Outlier Detection<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#clustering-and-outlier-detection" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Both clustering and outlier or anomaly detection are two opposites sides of the same coin.
In both cases, the question is where the mass of the data lies.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:clustering"></span>
<img src="figures/clustering-1.png" alt="Example of three clusters in a two-dimensional feature space. The data point on the top right could be called an outlier." width="\textwidth" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 11.2: Example of three clusters in a two-dimensional feature space. The data point on the top right could be called an outlier.
</p>
</div>
<p>Clusters are regions in the feature space with a high concentration of data points.
In terms of <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span>, these regions are modes of the distribution.
Outliers or anomalies are in regions where <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span> is small, which are regions in the feature space with almost no data points.
Clusters are usually defined such that all the data points within a cluster a similar in their feature values.
There are many different approaches for finding clusters: hierarchical clustering, k-means, k-medoids, DB-SCAN, PRIM, Gaussian mixture models, self-organizing maps, …
These clustering methods have various motivations, ranging from statistical to more algorithmic, again showing that unsupervised learning is externally motivated:
It isn’t particularly important <em>how</em> the clusters are detected.
Different clustering methods can find very different clusters.
Let’s take a look at a another solution for cluster analysis from Figure <a href="unsupervised-ml.html#fig:clustering1">11.1</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span style="display:block;" id="fig:clustering2"></span>
<img src="figures/clustering2-1.png" alt="Bad clustering solution, measured by Euclidean distance. But good solution if we are only interested in the horizontal direction, giving a weight of zero to the feature that distributes the data in the vertical direction." width="\textwidth" />
<p class="caption">
FIGURE 11.3: Bad clustering solution, measured by Euclidean distance. But good solution if we are only interested in the horizontal direction, giving a weight of zero to the feature that distributes the data in the vertical direction.
</p>
</div>
<!-- distance is difficult -->
<p>The clusters in Figure <a href="unsupervised-ml.html#fig:clustering2">11.3</a> are clearly a poor solution based on Euclidean distance.
But this assumes that both features matter are equally important for computing similarity.
Perhaps the feature that spreads the data in the horizontal direction is rather irrelevant, and we want to give it less weight in the distance computation?
Domain experts can tell you which features are important and which aren’t.
Usually, all features are weighted equally, which seems to be a sensible decision at first glance.
But in truth, any other weighting can an equally good choice.
For example, when clustering fruits, two of the features might be highly correlated:
We could use the features “volume” and “volume after peeling”.
In practice, we now have two features with almost the same information.
If we use both of the feature for clustering, it’s as if we give twice as much weight to the volume of the fruit as to any other feature.</p>
<p>And it gets worse.
What do we do when features are measured at different scales, such as a weight, a length, and a sum of money?
How can we even combine these features into a single distance measure, especially when the features even have different cardinalities, like numerical and categorical features?</p>
<p>“Excuse me, how do I get from point A to point B?”
“You go down this street and turn right after 10 meters. Then you go another $7 and turn left until red becomes blue!”.
And also, what’s closer to a banana? An apple or a lemon?
Sounds almost like an obscure interview question for a data scientist position at large web search company.
But it’s a question you better have some answers to if you do cluster analysis.</p>
<p>So no one can tell you what’s right.
As an unsupervised machine learner, you have to live with ambiguity.
Going to bed every night, questioning the fabric of space and time.
Supervised machine learners don’t have this problem, at least not to this extent.
The weighting of features is “supervised” by the relationship between the features and the target for which we know the ground truth.</p>
</div>
<div id="anomaly-detection" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="11.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.2</span> Anomaly Detection<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#anomaly-detection" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Cybersecurity specialists monitor events in the intranet.
Their job is to protect the company from cyber threats: Trade secret theft, malware, digital blackmail, you name it.
But there are thousands of employees who leave their digital footprint every day.
A mass, or rather, mess of data.
What does an attack look like?
The specialist has rules to detect some forms of attacks:
If someone tries to brute force a password to log into a service, that’s a red flag.
But what about all the behaviors that don’t follow such simple patterns, perhaps even unknown type of attacks?
Fortunately for the cybersecurity specialist, there is unsupervised learning.
Anomaly detection, an unsupervised learning task, is concerned with finding extreme data points.
Typical applications include financial fraud detection and cybersecurity.
Isolation forests, a popular anomaly detection tool, instead work by isolating data points that are extreme.
Other algorithms are directly motivated by probability distributions and flag data points as anomalies if they have a low probability.
Isolation forests, statistical tests, but also one-class support vector machines and hidden Markov models – the variety of methods shows yet again that machine learning, in this case unsupervised, is a very pragmatic modeling mindset.</p>
</div>
<div id="association-rule-learning" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="11.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.3</span> Association Rule Learning<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#association-rule-learning" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>I love grocery shopping.
Many people hate it, but only because they are unaware of it’s magnificence:
Supermarkets are incredible places that deserve awe and wonder and embody the progress and ingenuity of humanity.
Supermarkets are like the land of milk and honey.
It’s incredible what you can get in the supermarket: exotic fruits, spices from all over the world, products that take months or even years to make, like soy sauce, wine and cheese.
But I digress.
Let’s talk about association rule learning, which is usually introduced with shopping baskets as example.
When you go shopping, you can think of your shopping basket as a binary dataset.
Either you buy a certain item (1) or you don’t buy it (0).
Other people also go shopping and generate their own data of 0’s and 1’s.</p>
<p>The baskets might look like this: <span class="math inline">\(\{yeast, flour, salt\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{beer, chips\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{sandwich, lemonade, chips\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{cheese, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, flour, olive oil, chocolate, beer, chips\}\)</span>.
The goal of association rule learning is to detect the patterns of items.
Do people who buy flour often buy yeast?
Association rule mining is again a case of describing <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span>.
An association rule might be <span class="math inline">\(\{beer\} \Rightarrow \{chips\}\)</span> and would mean that people who buy beer frequently buy chips.
<!--
Then there is usually the constraint that all the items should be frequent, because the modeler would mostly care about modes in the distribution.
An association rule $\{pizza Hawaii\} \Rightarrow \{Gatorade\}$ might be very infrequent and therefore not interesting.
-->
In more formal terms, association rules are short descriptions that use conjunctive rules to describe high density regions in a binary feature space.
A well-known algorithm is the Apriori algorithm, but again, there are many option to choose from.
The next time you go to the supermarket, please take a moment.
Take it all in.
The fact that you have so many choices.
Many bad things are happening in the world, but when you stand in a supermarket (with enough money), you are living what humanity must have dreamed of for thousands of years and what we take for granted.
I hope you appreciate this as much as I do.</p>

<div id="dimensionality-reduction" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="11.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.3.4</span> Dimensionality Reduction<a href="unsupervised-ml.html#dimensionality-reduction" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there is the “curse of dimensionality”.
The curse is that data density decreases exponentially with each additional features.
If the number of data points remains constant, adding more features makes any modeling task more difficult, regardless of the mindset.
Dimensionality reduction can be used to break this curse, or at least reduce its burden.
If unsupervised learning regards all features, on what basis can we reduce the dimensionality?
Not all features contribute towards <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span>.
Some features may almost have no variance.
Other features may be highly correlated with other features.
In either case, we can select a subset of the features, and <span class="math inline">\(P(X)\)</span> will mostly look the same.
There are several methods for feature selection based on information-theoretic measures such as statistical correlation.</p>
<p>Or we can take our data and map it into a lower-dimensional space.
Those dimensionality reduction techniques usually make you wish you had paid better attention in linear algebra.
They can usually be represented as matrix multiplication of your original feature matrix: principal component analysis (PCA), ICA, non-negative matrix factorization, multidimensional scaling, t-SNE, and so on.
If each of your data point represents a fruit, features like height, width and weight could be mapped to a new feature / dimension that represents the volume of the fruit.</p>

</div>
<p>Unsupervised learning includes more tasks than just clustering, outlier detection, association rule learning and dimensionality reduction.
For example, archetypal analysis, latent variables, factor analysis, and more.
Unsupervised learning is truly the colorful bird among the modeling mindsets.</p>
<!-- 
## Difficult Evaluation 

I have already mentioned it.
Unsupervised means having no ground truth.
- no clear measure of success
- TODO: quote elements of statistical learning
- different from supervised in this regard
- supervised learning has clear target
- deviation from the target is clear measure of success
- unsupervised learning often evaluated with heuristics
- this lead to many different approaches of evaluation 

## Unsupervised versus Supervised 

- supervised first
- if you have labels, and you are interested in them, always use supervised first
- why?
- supervised is guided
- if you have clear goal, you should take this guidance
- another way: start with unsupervised learning
- whatever you discover, can be useful for next round of modeling 
- then you might switch mindset to, for example, supervised learning
- insights from unsupervised might help to remove some features, do feature engineering and son on
- how is unsupervised different from simple descriptive statistics?
- descriptive statistics = mean, median, variance
- in short, descriptive stats describes distribution
- difference: it's mostly univariate distribution. only one feature
- Sometimes two, like correlation and two-dimensional plots of something

## Misc

- difference to descriptive statistics: descriptive often one- or two-dimensional variables only looked at.
